**Abstract**  
Volunteer’s dilemma is an n-people binary choice game. One volunteer is  
enough to create a positive outcome which can be benefitted by all other  
players. Voluntary action is costly. If no-one volunteers, everybody gets  
zero payoff. Therefore, in order to receive a given benefit, at least one  
volunteer is needed. Social psychologists have been discussed this  
phenomenon for about 40 years under the term of “bystander effect”. Game  
theorists, after almost 20 years from the first paper on social psychology  
which discussed the bystander effect, came up with a game called  
“volunteer’s dilemma.” While the literature agrees on that both bystander  
effect and volunteer’s dilemma are reflecting the same social dilemmas, it  
is argued that there is an important difference between them and therefore  
we should be careful to employ the same solution concepts to both.  
Furthermore, common methodologies of experimental economics may not be  
suitable to study volunteer’s dilemma and therefore, we should re-consider  
the common experimental procedures while doing experiments on volunteer’s  
dilemma games. To test this argument, a pilot experiment involving 420  
subjects is carried out. Econometric results support the argument and  
provide a ground to discuss how to test volunteer’s dilemma with  
computerized laboratory methods.
